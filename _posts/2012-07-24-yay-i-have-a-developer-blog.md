So, it has come to this. I've set up a blog -- and a real one at that; not some Wordpress crap, but [authentic Jekyll-from-scratch, Git-powered awesomeness](http://comoyo.github.com/blog/2012/06/11/how-comoyo-built-its-blog/).

I've tried to keep blogs running before, but -- as with most people -- i ran out of topics to write about. Now, whether I actually ran out of topics to write about or I simply ran out of _knowledge_, I don't really know.

I think the problem might have been that I didn't dig deep enough to well up something of interest to other people, but that's (hopefully) slowly changing. Even though I'm nowhere near a virtuoso in any of my day-to-day work, I think I might have something to contribute to the interwebs this time around. At least more than before.

The first posts will most likely revolve around the concoction of technologies I've been spending time with this summer, 
namely backend-less [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org/)-driven Javascript, 
fancy-pantsy HTML5 stuff like [WebSockets](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/websockets/basics/) 
and [localStorage](http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2010/10/11/local-storage-and-how-to-use-it/), 
[responsive designs](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/responsive-web-design/), 
and perhaps mostly: _what happens if you try to smash them all together_. 
There's also a sizable chance I'll soon be spewing out some ramblings on some Ruby on Rails aspects I haven't seen too much of, like running multiple apps on a shared core backend using [the new Rails Engines introduced in Rails 3.1](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/engines.html).

Should you come back later for some actual content? Yes, please do.

_Stay classy, internet._
