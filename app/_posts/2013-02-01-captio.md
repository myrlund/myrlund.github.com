[Captio](http://boonbits.com/captio/) is a very simple application. It's a free note-taking app which sends e-mails to your inbox. At first glance, it seems like the most useless thing ever, but it can be so much more – _heavily_ depending on your productivity habits, of course.

I do most of my communication through e-mail, and I rely on using GMail's star functionality to keep my TODOs in check. (I might do a short article on my workflow in the future, if there is any interest out there.)

Turns out Captio fits in magnificently with this workflow. It is the perfect tool for capturing those tasks that _don't_ go through my e-mail. Whenever someone mentions something I need to do or remember I fire up Captio, punch in a couple of words, and _boom_ – it's in my backlog, and out of my mind.

The only functionality in Captio I don't use several times a day is the ability it has to attach images to the note. Who knows, however, maybe it will come in handy one day.

Anyways – if you have a similar workflow to me, do have a look at Captio.
